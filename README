                      Ubuntu Greasemonkey Scripts
                    --============[o]============--

The ubuntu-gm-scripts project collects useful Firefox GreaseMonkey
scripts that assist Launchpad bug triagers in working more effectively
and efficiently.

Installation
============
GreaseMonkey is a Firefox extension for adding macro-like capabilities
to do javascript-ish things on top of certain web pages.  To install
GreaseMonkey, follow these steps:

  * Go to Firefox->Tools->AddOns
  * Click Get Extensions (or Get Ubuntu AddOns if on Ubuntu)
  * Select GreaseMonkey, and install
  * Restart Firefox

Then to install these scripts, run:

  * firefox lp_karma_suffix.user.js
  * firefox lp_stockreplies.user.js

Or click on the scripts from your file browser.

For the latest updates to the scripts, go to the following link and
click 'download' for each of them:

Launchpad Karma Suffix
======================
When triaging bugs, it helps to have some way to gauge the relative
experience of the person reporting or commenting on a given bug.  This
tool helps by appending the person's karma score after their name.


Launchpad Stock Replies
=======================
When processing through a lot of bugs, often you wish to make
essentially the same comment over and over again, such as, "Thanks for
reporting this blah blah...  Please attach foo.log, so we can..."

This script helps avoid a lot of retyping or manual cut-n-pastes by
providing a way to store your own canned comments in Firefox itself.  It
then adds links for each of your canned comments right above the
"Comment on this change" field, making it convenient to select a stock
reply to send.

To add new stock replies, click the [+] link, which will bring up
options to add or save stock replies.

Add New Stock Reply:
  name        A tag id for the reply.  (Avoid punctuation)
  comment     Sets the comment field to this value
  status      Sets the status dropdown to this text key
  assign      Assigns the bug to this launchpad username
  importance  Sets the importance dropdown to this text key
  package     Sets the package field (if it is present) to this text

Save Stock Replies:
  After making additions or changes to any of the replies, click this to 
  save the changes.
