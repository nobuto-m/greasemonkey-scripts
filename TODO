* (DONE) Add a TESTING file
  PROBLEM:  When Launchpad changes its layout, it may or may not break
    some of these lp greasemonkey scripts.  We need a procedural way for
    someone to quickly walk through each script in turn to doublecheck
    that it is still behaving appropriately.
  + (DONE) Make a TESTING file, with a section for each greasemonkey script
  + (DONE) Create/identify a dummy Launchpad bug to run the scripts against
  + (DONE) For each script, outline a procedure for what to look for to check
    that the script is installed, altering the page render correctly,
    and that its buttons and added links are working correctly.

* Stock Reply Filtering by Project/Source:
  PROBLEM:  Over time, you may find yourself accumulating a large
    number of replies, many of which will be applicable to a specific
    component (e.g. requests to attach Xorg.0.log are only appropriate
    for Xorg packages).
  + Add a "project" filter field, to specify a reply only applies for
    the listed project(s).
  + Add a "source" filter field, to specify a reply only applies for
    the listed source(s).

* Stock Stock Replies:
  PROBLEM: We ship lp_stockreplies.js with no predefined replies,
    requiring each user to manually add their own.  We should provide a
    small set of extremely common ones to save them this work, and to
    promote standardized replies by bug triagers.
  + See:  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/Responses

* Bulk installation:
  PROBLEM: Currently users have to install scripts manually, one at a
    time.  It would be nice to have a script that installs all the
    scripts automatically, or at least makes the operation a one-shot
    deal.
  + Can we just copy them directly into this dir?
    ~/.mozilla/firefox<random>.<profile>/gm_scripts/
  + The profiles can be figured out from the profiles.ini file.

* Permanently saving changes:
  PROBLEM:  Currently, scripts that allow the user to change
    configuration settings (like the stock replies script), save changes
    only when firefox is exited normally.  If it crashes or is killed,
    nothing will be saved.
  + Can we GET/POST to a localhost url?
  + Is there a routine to prompt GM to save its settings?
  + Can we auto-write into this file?
    ~/.mozilla/firefox<random>.<profile>/gm_scripts/config.xml
  + Consider this:
    http://wiki.greasespot.net/Security_tips#Use_data:URIs.2C_not_remote_resources
  + Dumping an object's contents:
    http://wiki.greasespot.net/Code_snippets#Dump_the_properties_of_an_object
  + An issue to consider is that all prefs are kept in FF memory
    always.  See:
    http://groups.google.com/group/greasemonkey-users/browse_thread/thread/ca5a0dfac5c5998b

* Copying/sharing settings to different machines:
  PROBLEM:  If you make some changes, such as defining several stock
    replies, it's not clear how to easily share those changes to other
    machines.  One idea is to script the copying of these changes from
    the command line.  Another idea would be to modify each script to
    allow publishing of customizations to a central website.
  + Greasemonkey scripts are always installed to:
    ~/.mozilla/firefox<random>.<profile>/gm_scripts/
  + Presumably, a script could copy the contents of this dir from one
    machine to another.
