                      Ubuntu Greasemonkey Scripts
                    --============[o]============--

The ubuntu-gm-scripts project collects useful Firefox GreaseMonkey
scripts that assist Launchpad bug triagers in working more effectively
and efficiently.

Installation
============
GreaseMonkey is a Firefox extension for adding macro-like capabilities
to do javascript-ish things on top of certain web pages.  To install
GreaseMonkey, follow these steps:

  * Go to Firefox->Tools->AddOns
  * Click Get Extensions (or Get Ubuntu AddOns if on Ubuntu)
  * Select GreaseMonkey, and install
  * Restart Firefox

Then to install these scripts, run:

  * firefox lp_karma_suffix.user.js
  * firefox lp_stockreplies.user.js
  * firefox lp_patches.user.js

Or click on the scripts from your file browser.

For the latest updates to the scripts, go to the following link and
click 'download' for each of them:

Launchpad Karma Suffix
======================
When triaging bugs, it helps to have some way to gauge the relative
experience of the person reporting or commenting on a given bug.  This
tool helps by appending the person's karma score after their name.

As well, team membership can denote experience/involved-ness, so this
tool also appends icons indicating for some teams that the person is
in.  This is helpful for flagging comments/flags from the bug triaging
team, core developers, and so on.

As there are a LOT of teams in launchpad, most of which you may not care
about, only a select number of teams are included by default.  You can
customize the list by editing the Javascript as follows:

  * In Firefox go to Tools->Greasemonkey->Manage User Scripts
  * Select LP_Karma_Suffix
  * Click the Edit button at the bottom, and type in the name of your
    preferred text editor.  E.g. "/usr/bin/gedit" or
    "C:\windows\notepad.exe"
  * Scroll down to the 'team_handler' function and find where the teams
    variable is defined, then add a line with your new team.  For
    instance, to add the Inkscape Bug Team to your list, modify teams to
    look like this:

    var teams = {
        'inkscape.bugs':'',
        'motu-swat':'',
        'bugsquad':'',
        'ubuntu-core-dev':'',
        'ubuntu-dev':'',
        'ubuntu-bugcontrol':'',
        'ubuntumembers':''
    };

   * [Note that the team must have a 14x14 icon defined with it in order
     to see anything.  This can be set by a team admin via the 'Change
     branding' link on the Launchpad team overview page.]
   * Save and exit the text editor, then go back to the Manage User
     Scripts dialog and click OK.
   * Reload some pages to see the icon.  :-)


Launchpad Stock Replies
=======================
When processing through a lot of bugs, often you wish to make
essentially the same comment over and over again, such as, "Thanks for
reporting this blah blah...  Please attach foo.log, so we can..."

This script helps avoid a lot of retyping or manual cut-n-pastes by
providing a way to store your own canned comments in Firefox itself.  It
then adds links for each of your canned comments right above the
"Comment on this change" field, making it convenient to select a stock
reply to send.

To add new stock replies, click the [+] link, which will bring up
options to add or save stock replies.

Add New Stock Reply:
  name        A tag id for the reply.  (Avoid punctuation)
  comment     Sets the comment field to this value.
  status      Sets the status dropdown to this text key (if present).
  assign      Assigns the bug to this launchpad username (if present).
              Special names:
                -me      To assign to yourself
                -nobody  To unassign
  importance  Sets the importance dropdown to this text key (if present).
  package     Sets the package field to this text (if present).

Save Stock Replies:
  After making additions or changes to any of the replies, click this to
  save the changes.


Greasemonkey Settings
=====================
It seems that Firefox or Greasemonkey does not atomically save settings
to disk.  As a result, it is best to close Firefox completely after making
large changes to the stock replies so that they are saved to disk for sure.
In the event of a Firefox crash, many people have had issues with stock
replies disappearing.


Launchpad Patches
=================
It is possible to flag an attachment as a patch in Launchpad.  However, from
the bug's main page one has to click on the "edit" link next to an attachment
to determine if it is flagged as a patch.  This script removes that extra step
by identifying which attachments have been marked as patches.

Attachments are normally identified by a green downward pointing arrow, now
ones flagged as patches will be identified as a star.  Patches will be
identified in both the attachments portlet and in comments.


Launchpad Highlight Me
======================
This adds a visual highlight to things belonging/assigned to the logged-in
user. Currently this only highlights rows in +milestone pages, so you can
quickly see specs and bugs assigned to yourself. No configuration needed.
